In this project, we reconstructed naturalistic images directly from macaque brain signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based decoder. We explored how different brain regions, like V1, V4, and IT, contribute to image decoding. This research helps bridge the gap between low-level and high-level brain signals, enabling high-precision reconstructions and revealing new insights into how the brainâ€™s representations are mapped into visual pixels.

### Key Highlights:
- CNN-based decoding for brain signals
- Space-time-resolved decoding technique
- Investigation of different brain regions' contributions
- High-precision natural image reconstructions
